						<h2 id="margo">Hey Gta people!<br>
							<br> This site is made for testing popular  armoured vehicles, fighter jets, helicopters and special vehicles in the PVP world.The most used ones,we tried for now, with the most common explosive weapons.</h2> </div>
					<div class="blog-image-1"> <img src="images/main.png"> </div>
				<div class="announcement">
					<p>To clarify something: All testings were done to fully upgraded vehicles,planes, helicopters .
						<br> Also, something we noticed during that process of it is, lets say a vehicle needs 4 RPG rockets to be destroyed,first time it happened to 4 rockets,then to 5  and then to 3.
						<br> So we put on the site,the most common one that occured because we tried it multiple times for every vehicle, helicopter,plane.
						<br> Although that didn't happen like to all,maybe 2 or 3 vehicles,still we feel that you need to know that.<br> Rockstar is a bit ..weird when it comes to vehicle health and weapons damage..Anyway, hope its helpful:)</a></p>
